# Decisions

Architectural and design decisions that are intentional and should not be flagged by reviewers.

## capture-brief Phase 3 keeps cognitive science inline

The capture-brief skill includes cognitive science principles (anchoring bias, framing effects, etc.) directly in the skill content rather than referencing an external expertise file. This is intentional: agents are more likely to read and apply material that appears inline within the skill they are following than to follow a reference to a separate file.

## Skills are bundled in the binary and materialized on demand

Skills live in the `skills/` source directory with `references/` symlinks to expertise files. At build time, `build.rs` walks the tree, dereferences symlinks, and generates a `BUNDLED_SKILL_FILES` constant. At runtime, `materialize_skill()` writes the bundled content to disk with atomic writes. Review skills materialize to `.fluent/work/skills/` for reviewers; the `fluent` interactive skill installs to `~/.claude/skills/` via `fluent skills`. Skills reference `references/X.md` in their SKILL.md, never `expertise/X.md` directly.

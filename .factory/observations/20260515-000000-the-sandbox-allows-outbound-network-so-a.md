2026-05-15 — The sandbox allows outbound network, so a malicious
package's postinstall script could exfiltrate workspace contents via
HTTP. The sandbox prevents credential theft and privilege escalation
but not data exfiltration. Options: (A) network proxy allowlisting
API endpoints only, (B) deny outbound except localhost with credential
proxy mediating all API access, (C) read-only package caches. Option
B aligns with isolation-by-impossibility principle.
